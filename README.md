- select the search engine and just search. No need to waste time going from A to B just to make a search on B.
- get updated hackernews top posts on the homepage with a single click of a button. 
- quickly type your todos or short notes to never forget a thing. Drag them to reorder easily.
- bookmarks (like google new tab) are also supported , and yeah, not limited to 10 only.
- everything is saved locally on web storage so nothing bottlenecks this website.

#### Google lighthouse report for the website shows it is not going to slow you down though i am working on making it 100 on all aspects.
